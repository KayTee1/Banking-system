# Bank Account Management System

A simple Banking system as a challenge to see how much have I improved since my first C++ project.
It's also the first time I've implemented the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style in my code.

# Introduction

This project is a simple bank account management system implemented in C++. It allows users to create new bank accounts, manage their accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and delete their accounts.

# Compiling and Running the program

g++ -o main *.cpp

./main

# Functions

There are 3 main functions in this program

- Creating a new account
- Deleting an account
- Managing your account

In the manageAccount function, you can:

- Add balance
- Withdraw money

# Input Validation

In this project, the inputValidation function is used throughout the program to validate that user inputs are within the valid range. It takes three parameters: the user's input, the lowest-, and the highest valid value. Function returns true or false accordingly.
